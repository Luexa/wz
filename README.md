An I/O agnostic WebSocket 1.3 library for Zig.

Currently untested, contributions towards a test suite are appreciated.

## Features

* Past the initial handshake which relies on std.http, wz performs no allocations and uses a single buffer for all parsing.
* Works with any Reader and Writer.

## Notes

* wz does **not** buffer either reads or writes, if you prefer the performance boost such buffering provides, you must
  provide your own buffered Reader and Writers.

## Examples

**Coming Soon...**
